The Whole Tale: ecological niche modeling with MaxEnt
=====================================================

At present, I am a doctoral candidate at the [University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.illinois.edu) 
in [Informatics](http://informatics.illinois.edu). This
Summer 2018 I was fortunately accepted as an intern in the [Whole Tale
Project](https://wholetale.org) and mentored by 
[Prof. Betram Ludaescher](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/faculty/ludaesch), faculty
at the [iSchool](https://ischool.illinois.edu) and 
[NCSA](https://ischool.illinois.edu).

My project focuses on reproducibility of ecological niche
models. In practice, collecting and cataloguing organisms
is constrained by the amount of people in the field, the
area to cover and the availability of prior information.
Being able to predict with some degree of accuracy the
expected location of a species based on prior observations
is not only informative for field work, but essential to
take action in various issues such as the impact of climate
change in ecosystems and subsequent potential, irreparable
loss of biodiversity.

In particular, my internship builds on prior theoretical
and applied (i.e. software) work on how entropy in the
distribution of samples, when coupled with information
about the environment (i.e. background data) can help
find how likely it is to find an organism in a given
location. The original model is called 
[MaxEnt](http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent) since
it maximizes the probability distribution for the observations
while remaining parsimonious.

The ongoing coding efforts are hosted at the 
[iDAKS MaxEnt](https://github.com/idaks/intros-MaxEnt) GitHub repository.
