### Introduction: integrating the algorithmics into a usable model

This week the effort has been focused on bringing together parts of the implementation into a model structure. There are several goals with respect to users, inspired by various packages (including [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org)). At least, we want the package to work both within and outside of The Whole Tale. The latter, for instance will ensure that people can easily preserve one Jupyter Notebook in the WT environment while playing with parts of the model.

The following list of user requirements comprises the current effort:

- The model should be able to capture the notion of an experiment. For reproducibility to occur, the practices of computational science must change. Instead of 'running code', we must move towards executing an experiment.
- Users should be able to annotate their experiments. The bioinformatics community has already solved many provenance issues related to giving credit to scholars. This is essential also to increase recognition of scholars who must also become their own [Research Software Engineers](http://rse.ac.uk/who/).
- All the context of an experiment should be loadable from a file, including all required elements to initialize the abstract machine.
- The whole experiment should be 'packageable' 

### Handling geographic position data

### Provenance information for environmental features

One of the central elements of ecological niche models is choosing the right features that may predict an organism's behavior. We have a new capability that documents features expected to be found in the model. Suppose we have the file 'features.csv' for a three-fingered sloth:

´´´csv
Feature,Description,DOI
TEMP,"Temperature","10.2307/1374287"
HUM,"Relative humidity","10.1007/BF00694571"
´´´
