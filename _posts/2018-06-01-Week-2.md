### Introduction: design of MaxEnt for The Whole Tale in Python

The main goal tackled this week, has been the design of a Python MaxEnt version of the software. Several requirements are in order. The current implementations in Python that can be found in various GitHub repositories have something in common: they miss the geospatial character ofdata consumption as well as provenance data.

However, the design for the Whole Tale needs to be more friendly than that of the original MaxEnt software package. Friendly, at least, to the Whole Tale environment in Python.
